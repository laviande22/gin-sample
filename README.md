# Building REST API Server Using Gin for PostgreSQL!

Sample project for building a REST API server using Gin and PostgreSQL, which are connected each other by GORM. This project is highly inspired by [Velopert](https://github.com/velopert)'s sample project [gin-rest-api-sample](https://github.com/velopert/gin-rest-api-sample).

Unlike the original Velopert's one, this project lacks several features including authentication and live reloading. The reason why I omitted these features is that I am a beginner in Go language by myself, so I wanted to learn the essential CRUD part first to figure out how to write a **working** server-side application in Go. I'm still working on this project and after writing code is done, I am going to share what I learned by articles.
